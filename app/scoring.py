Credit Scoring System
====================

This module provides guidance for implementing a credit scoring system based on digital presence.
Students should implement their own scoring algorithm based on the following criteria:

1. Website Score (30 points):
   - Domain age (10 points)
   - SSL certificate (5 points)
   - Mobile responsiveness (5 points)
   - Content quality (10 points)

2. Social Media Score (30 points):
   - Follower count (10 points)
   - Engagement rate (10 points)
   - Post frequency (5 points)
   - Content quality (5 points)

3. Local Presence Score (40 points):
   - Google Maps rating (15 points)
   - Number of reviews (10 points)
   - Business listing completeness (10 points)
   - Local citations (5 points)

Total possible score: 100 points
